 * 
 * What is API's? 
 * API stands for Application Programming Interface. 
 * API is a mechanisms that enables software component to communicate using a set of defination and protocols.
 * 
 * How does API work? 
 * API architechture is explained in terms of client and server.
 *  The application sending a request is known as client and the application sending response is known as server.
 * 
 * Their are four different ways that API can work depending on the situation
 *    SOAP APIs--> 1) These APIs use Simple Object Access Protocol. 
 *                 2) Client and server exchange messages using XML.
 *                 3) This is a less flexible API that was more popular in the past.
 * 
 *   RPC APIs --> 1) These APIs are called Remote Procedure Calls.
 *                2) The client completes a function (or procedure) on the server, and the server sends the output back to the client.
 * 
 *   Websocket APIs --> 1) Websocket APIs is another modern web API development that uses JSON objects to pass data.
 *                      A WebSocket API supports two-way communication between client apps and the server.
 *                The server can send callback messages to connected clients, making it more efficient than REST API.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * What are REST APIs?  
 * Rest stands for representational state transfer API's. It is a set of functions like GET, POST, DELETE etc that client uses
 * to get the server data. Client access the server data through HTTP.
