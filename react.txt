Q) What is the difference between ES6 and ES5 ?
Components and Function
ES5:
var MyFunction= React.createClass({
    render: function(){
        return(
            <>
            <p>Hello world!</p>
            </>
        )
    }
})

ES6:
class MyFunction extends React.component {
    render(){
        return(
            <p>Hello ES6</p>
        )
    }
}

require vs import:
ES5: var React= require("react");
ES6: import React from "react";

It also helps to determine which component needs to be re-rendered instead of rendering all the components.
